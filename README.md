# Sudoku #
This Project is a classic Sudoku video game.
### GUI ###
The GUI makes for most of the actual code. The GUI is built on Java's ```Swing``` (along with ```Graphics```) library which is a simple graphics library which allowed me to create my own GUI system for my game.
### Logic ###
Like the UI, the logic is also built in ```Java```. The current algorithm for generating the grid is simple and will usually generate grids with multiple solutions. Some time in the future I want to upgrade the algorithm to something that actually works.
### Launch file ###
The launch file is built in in ```C++```. The launch file automatically compiles and executes the program in the right way, when starting the program please use the ```sudoku.exe``` file.
