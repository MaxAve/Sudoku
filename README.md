# Sudoku #
This Project is a classic Sudoku video game.\
The logic and UI are built in pure ```Java``` while the executable is built in ```C++```. At the moment the executable uses a direct path
to launch the main ```Java``` file, so the executable will not work on your device. You can still play the game by compiling and executing the main ```Java``` file:
```
javac Sudoku.java
java Sudoku
```
(note that you need to be in the src folder in order to access the files)
